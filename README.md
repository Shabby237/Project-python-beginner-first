- Project contributors are restricted to a group of students who wish to work and learn together.

## How to contribute to the project

This project is beginner friendly :smiley:

I hope we can finish it within the month of **November**.

If you are new to github, you may probably be asking

"How do I contribute to this project :question:"

Well, here is how to start:

1. Fork this repo: This creates a copy in your github account

1. Clone your forked repo: This creates a copy of the repo on your local machine.
   On git terminal, enter the following command.

```
git clone git@github.com:Your-Github-Name/Project-python-beginner-first.git
```

3. Move to the project on your local machine

```
cd Project-python-beginner-first
```

4. Check that your fork is the "origin" remote

```
git remote -v
```

If not, to add the fork as origin:

```
git remote add origin Your-Github-Name/Project-python-beginner-first.git
```

5. Add the original project repo as upstream

```
git remote add origin Shabby237/Project-python-beginner-first.git
```

6. Create a new branch

```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

7. Make the necessary changes to the branch.

8. Stage the changes

```
git add /main.py
```

In case where all modified files should be staged:

```
git add .
```

9. Commit the changes

```
git commit -m "modified main.py"
```

Here `m` is the message (a description of changes made).
If no message is entered, then the commit is canceled.

**NB:** Changes can be staged and commited in one command:

```
git commit -am "modified main.py"
```
